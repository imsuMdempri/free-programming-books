- A keygen is unsafe. Many keygens are infected with malware, viruses, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You could lose your data, compromise your security, or damage your system by using a keygen.
- A keygen is unethical. Using a keygen is unfair to the developers of Art Vista Virtual Grand Piano, who spent time and money to create this software. You are depriving them of their rightful income and discouraging them from making more quality products in the future.
