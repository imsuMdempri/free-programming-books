 - The keyword: This is the main topic or phrase that you want your article to rank for in search engines. You should use it in your title and throughout your article, but not too much or too little. A good rule of thumb is to use it once in the title, once in the introduction, once in the conclusion, and a few times in the body paragraphs. You should also use related keywords or synonyms to avoid keyword stuffing and increase relevance. - The audience: This is the group of people who are interested in your topic and who you want to attract to your website. You should write in a way that appeals to them, using appropriate language, tone, and style. You should also provide useful information, answer their questions, and solve their problems. - The purpose: This is the goal or objective that you want to achieve with your article. It could be to inform, persuade, entertain, or educate your audience. You should have a clear idea of what you want them to do after reading your article, such as clicking a link, buying a product, signing up for a newsletter, or sharing your content. - The structure: This is the way you organize your article into different sections and paragraphs. You should have a clear introduction that introduces your topic and keyword, a clear conclusion that summarizes your main points and calls your audience to action, and several body paragraphs that support your thesis with evidence and examples. You should also use headings, subheadings, bullet points, lists, images, and other formatting elements to make your article easy to read and scan.  Here is an example of a title and article that I generated based on these factors:
